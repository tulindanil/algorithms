Remote Play is one of the PS4's more underrated features, probably because it only lets you stream your games to the
ailing PS Vita and some equally ailing Sony smartphones But if you have the equipment, it's a great way to free up a
TV while playing games like Fallout 4 — and it sounds like more people will be able to find that out soon In a tweet,
Sony's president of Worldwide Studios confirms that the company is working on a Remote Play app for PC and Mac

The app should bring Sony in line with Microsoft, which launched Xbox One streaming functionality alongside Windows 10,
while making PS4-owning Mac users happy too The next step would hopefully be expanding mobile compatibility beyond
Sony's own phones to the wider Android ecosystem and iOS But even if that doesn't happen, the desktop app will let
you continue your Destiny raid even if someone needs the TV in time for the football kickoff


DJI is known for its consumer drones; the Phantom 3 series is our recommendation for the best drone you can buy
But the Chinese company's latest model, the eight-rotor Agras MG-1, goes in another direction entirely — it's
designed for agricultural use The primary use of the Agras is spraying crops, with the ability to cover between
seven and ten acres an hour and a tank that holds 10 liters about 26 gallons of liquid

DJI says the Agras is over 40 times more efficient than manual spraying Using a microwave radar, the drone can
scan the ground below and maintain the right distance from crops to spray the correct amount of liquid It flies
up to eight meters per second, modulating its spraying for even coverage It can be used in automatic,
semi-automatic, or manual operation, and is designed for durability with dustproofing, water resistance, and an
anti-corrosive build The Agras also folds down into a compact package after use

Agriculture is considered a prime area of potential growth in the drone industry because of the technology's ability to
help survey crops and gather real-time information on farmland And companies like DJI will be able to charge far higher
prices than the $1,000 or so that their consumer Phantom drones command — the Agras will cost "roughly $15,000,"
according to The Wall Street Journal DJI is launching it in China and Korea at first, with availability in other
markets to follow

Ridley Scott used to be the poster child for never doing sequels, but after bending that rule with Prometheus and
breaking it by co-writing and producing the upcoming Blade Runner 2, it seems the legendary director is now determined
to make as many Alien films as possible Alien: Covenant will not, as previously announced, be the second film in a
prequel trilogy that started with Prometheus; it will in fact be the beginning of its own trilogy

"Prometheus was borne out of my frustration that on Alien in 1979 — I only did one as I don't normally do sequels,"
Scott said at a press conference in Sydney, in comments picked up on by The Hollywood Reporter "I was amazed that in
the three that followed that no-one asked the question 'why the alien, who made it and why?' Very basic questions So I
came up with the notion of Prometheus, which starts to indicate who might have made it and where it came from"

"So I'm now going to the next one, which is the next evolution directly connected with the first one and we'll kind
of pick it up there and it will evolve When that's finished there'll be another one and then another one which will
gradually drive into the back entrance of the film in 1979 So in other words, why was this space jockey there and why
did he have an alien inside him? And those questions will be answered," Scott continued

Just so you're keeping track, this is a director who doesn't "normally do sequels" planning a total of four films to
correct perceived mistakes made by the directors who did do sequels to one of his own films Scott had hinted at this
before, and now it seems he's getting his way after the prior announcement of a mere two Prometheus sequels It also
means that District 9 director Neill Blomkamp's on-hold Alien movie is likely further off than ever

As for Alien: Covenant itself, Scott calls it a "very complex story" that Prometheus star Noomi Rapace will only make a
brief appearance in, although Michael Fassbender is set to return in a leading role Shooting is set to start in
Australia from May, and despite the mixed reaction to Prometheus, the new trilogy may at least land in a cinema climate
with a new-found bug for sci-fi "Star Wars will be a juggernaut," Scott "quipped," as THR tells it "Why do you think
I'm doing sequels?"

There are plenty of options for keeping your digital media safe and easily accessible in the cloud Google, Microsoft,
Apple, and Yahoo all have services that will let you back up tons of old files Amazon is a major player in providing
cloud services to other companies and has leveraged that expertise to create offerings for average consumers and perks
for its Prime subscribers Today it's rolling out a limited-time offer just in time for Black Friday: $5 for unlimited
online storage

The deal may be of particular interest to users of Microsoft's OneDrive Previously that company had been offering
unlimited storage to Office 365 subscribers, but recently downgraded that to 1 TB of space, stating that a few
extreme users were taking advantage of the system well beyond the needs of average users "A small number of users
backed up numerous PCs and stored entire movie collections and DVR recordings,” the company said "In some
instances, this exceeded 75 TB per user or 14,000 times the average"

Google Drive has unlimited storage for people who are signed up through a work account, but caps free consumer
accounts at 15GB before asking for payment The copious amount of free storage out there from companies with other
principle revenue streams explains why Dropbox, which makes all its money charging for storage, is in danger of
losing its luster among investors

If you've got a massive collection of files that you've been meaning to back up but didn't want to pay full freight,
Amazon's current offer seems like a great opportunity to finally make that move Just remember that the price
changes back to the full $60 a year after the trial is over And fair warning: even if you do finally get everything
into the cloud, that's no guarantee you're actually going to feel motivated to organize it all

After showing off a range of OLED TVs at this year's CES, LG reaffirmed its commitment to OLED technology again
today — LG Display will spend more than 10 trillion won $871 billion to build a factory that will produce OLED
panels in the South Korean city of Paju, to open in the first half of 2018

IT'S RUMORED APPLE WILL USE OLED PANELS IN IPHONES

LG Display will spend an initial 184 trillion won $16 billion to build the plant, which will produce both large
screens for TVs, and flexible panels for cars and smaller devices such as smartwatches Both Samsung and Sony have
backed away from using the technology for TVs in favor of LCD panels, but Panasonic has joined LG in supporting the
tech, launching its first commercial OLED TVs earlier this year But the company thinks they're still too expensive
— in September, Masahiro Shinada, head of Panasonic's TV arm, said that it would take OLED TVs two or three years
before the market for the technology expanded

LG's plans show its continued investment in OLED TVs, but the technology could also become a major source of income,
if — as rumored — Apple is indeed planning to adopt OLED technology for its iPhones from 2018 In a report published
yesterday, Nikkei said that LG Display was planning capacity upgrades in response to Apple's decision, as the
American company consulted with display providers to secure a stable source of OLED screens LG Display has not
commented on the rumors, but the company already has a relationship with Apple, reportedly providing it with the
OLED displays used in the Apple Watch

Flying coach in commercial airliners is already a fairly miserable process, but it can seem like aircraft designers are
bent on making the experience even worse Manufacturer Airbus' latest patent, approved yesterday after it was applied
for in 2013, proposes a modular cabin into which passengers can be seated before their plane even arrives That cabin
would then be attached to the plane after the previous module was removed, cutting down the time it takes to prepare
planes for flight, and assisting in airlines' desperate bids to cram more humans into narrow metal tubes thousands
of feet in the sky

The patent filing describes a removable cabin module, "comprising a floor, an upper aircraft fuselage portion
connected to the floor, and a first and a second end wall, wherein the first and second end walls, the floor and the
upper aircraft fuselage portion form a cabin" The document says the cabins could be modified "for transport of
passengers, luggage, freight or combinations thereof" As shown in the accompanying pictures, in Airbus' model,
airplane fuselages become trucks, pulling up at airports to get their next container of people, before taking off
again

THE PATENT MIGHT NOT EVER MAKE IT INTO REAL AIRPLANES

While being dropped onto a pair of wings like a Lego brick before being launched into the sky won't appease the
minds of nervous flyers, Airbus' latest patent is at least more humane than the one it applied for in October,
which saw passengers stacked on top of each other in a writhing mass of humanity in order to save space Airbus
isn't even the only company trying to test its evil science on airline passengers Zodiac Seats France showed off a
hellish seating arrangement earlier this year that supposedly maximized space in economy class by flipping the
middle seats around, making passengers to face each other, and forcing them to stare into their seat neighbors'
eyes while their hands are jammed against their butts

For the moment, thankfully, all of these concepts are just at the patenting stage — there's no guarantee that they
will ever actually make it into a real-life airplane But know that as you read this, somewhere inside Airbus and
Boeing headquarters, hooded figures are already designing the next stages in passenger innovation Electrified
seats, perhaps, or a new method of forcibly folding the human body into smaller and more convenient shapes Until
then, cherish your long security lines, frequent delays, and uncomfortable flights

The exhibit is heavily influenced by the 1964 World's Fair, which was held in Queens and played a big role in the
popularization of computers "Before then, computing was something that was thought of as business, science, even
defense and military," Stephen Edidin, the museum's chief curator, says "What happened at the fair is that computers
were allowed to be presented to everybody"

Much of this happened in what's known as "The Egg," IBM's dome-shaped pavilion at the fair Visitors to the
Silicon City exhibit begin their journey in a small-scale version of The Egg, where they can watch footage of
those fair-goers experiencing computers for the first time

After this, the exhibit really begins, transforming into a physical timeline of computing in New York You could,
honestly, move through the entire thing in less than 30 seconds It's not massive by any means But with more than
300 items, you'd be wise to take as much time as you can Maybe you've never seen a 5 1/4 floppy disk before, or
played Space Invaders on an original cabinet Maybe you never saw the first transatlantic satellite broadcast, or
the satellite that made it possible Maybe you didn't even know these things existed

THE WHOLE EXHIBIT ECHOES THE 1964 WORLD'S FAIR
These things and many more some of which you can see in the photos below are on display through April of 2016 at
the museum, thanks in part to generous loans from partners like IBM and Googleorg In fact, Google is even
offering free coding workshops and exhibition field trips to all New York City schools as well as all "Tier 1"
schools outside the city in tandem with the Silicon City exhibit

The story that the exhibit doesn't tell is why New York lost this proverbial computer war with California — a
story that will hopefully someday warrant an exhibit all its own But Silicon City tells the New York with extreme
care and detail, and is certainly worth the $20 admission

When you think of the history of computers, it's easy to mentally jump right into the garages and basements of
Silicon Valley, or even the Silicon Prairie of Texas that is so moodily depicted in Halt and Catch Fire You
probably don't, however, immediately think of New York 

New York has a history as long, if not longer, than some of the other places in this country that often flaunt the
word "silicon" in their nicknames And it's why, this weekend, the New York Historical Society is opening an
half-year-long exhibit called Silicon City "This is a story that has been forgotten by many, many people,
especially after Northern California stole the spotlight," Louise Mirrer, president of the New York Historical
Society, says
